**Making Crypto Payments as Easy as Speaking or Typing**

---

## 📖 Introduction

In the evolving digital landscape, crypto payments and transactions are becoming increasingly important. However, most crypto payment solutions remain too technical for the average user — requiring wallet addresses, QR code scanning, and manual confirmations. EchoPay solves this challenge by harnessing the power of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **voice recognition** to enable seamless and intuitive crypto payments.

EchoPay is built to process natural language commands — whether typed or spoken — and translate them into precise payment actions on the blockchain. By removing the complexities of manual crypto transactions, EchoPay makes the world of crypto accessible to everyone.
